### Hey, I'm Bipin Paul 👋

I've spent the last **7+ years** building web applications for everything from social media platforms to healthcare systems. My favorite stack is **.NET Core** and **Blazor**, and while I specialize in solving complex backend problems, I'm just as comfortable working across the full stack.
